Count number of occurrences of a number in a sorted array with duplicates Given a sorted array of integers containing duplicates, count occurrences of a number provided. If the element is not found, return 0; Input Array: [2,5,5,5,6,6,7]; Target Number: 5 Output: 3 // 5 has come 3 times in the array Use only Binary Search Algorithm

Scoring in Exam Milly is at the examination hall where she is reading a question paper. She checked the question paper and discovered that there are N questions in that paper. Each question has some score value. Ideally it's like questions requiring more time have more score value and strangely no two questions on the paper require same time to be solved.

She is very excited by looking these questions. She decided to solve K questions while maximizing their score value. Could you please help Milly to determine the exact time she needs to solve the questions.

Input Time: [2,3,9,4,5] Score: [3,5,11,6,7] K = 3 Output 18 // 9+4+5 for the scores 11,6,7

Use Bubble Sort

Given a set of strings print the set sorted according to their size. If the size of the strings are equal, must maintain the original order of the set. Input: ["ab", "cd", "e", "j", "asd", "ljffg", "df"]; Output: ["e" "j" "ab" "cd" "df" "asd" "ljffg"]; Use Merge Sort

Repeat Question 3 using Quick Sort. *Ignore the original order (Initial order can change) -->
